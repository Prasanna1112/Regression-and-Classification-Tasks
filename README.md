# Regression-and-Classification-Tasks

For file labeled "Assignment 10":

Performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python Pandas, including dropping irrelevant fields for predicted values, and standardization of each attribute.

Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models were created for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan distance. The performance of the two models using different distance
metrics were compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and Scikit-Learn Classification Report.

Data preprocessing was done in a single file for Data.csv dataset.

As for the rest of the files, classification and regression tasks were completed on Social_Networks_Ads.csv dataset.

All these datasets are compiled in one folder for ease.
